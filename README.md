# My first project that I launched as a website
# It is a creatinine clearance calculator that takes user input for a patient's age, weight, and serum creatinine
# These values are used to estimate a patient's kidney function which is often used to dose medications
# Below the main calculation field is a tool to help determine which weight should be used for the calculation above (actual, adjusted, or ideal bodyweight)
